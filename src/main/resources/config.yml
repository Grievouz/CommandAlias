# This plugin supports PlaceHolderAPI but there are some native placeholders too:
# %name% - Name of the person doing the command
# %display_name% - Display-name of the person doing the command.

# The prefix that will show before /ca
prefix: '&7[&aCommandAlias&7] &c'
# No permission message.
noPermission: '{prefix}No permission!'

advanced:
  # Should it keep iterating through commands when it finds a match?
  # Enabling this can be useful if you have one alias doing multiple things.
  keep-iterating-when-match: false
  # Should the command run through if they do not have the permission?
  # Enabling this can be useful if you want to use an alias as a custom no permission message.
  let-command-event-run-if-no-perm: false

# Create a command here.
# Here are lots of examples, feel free to delete them as you wish.
# Argument placeholders are also available to use for more complex needs. You can access them with {1}, {2} etc..
# like 'lp user {1} parent set {2}' for /setgroup MyUser MyGroupName
